<h2>Project and data</h2>
<p>the most important things here are the projects. A project is a work you do</p>
<p>This work could be a personal job (dont fill the company text) or professional job ( fill it with company name)</p>
<p>you could have to put your init date and end date to show it in the timeline view</p>
<p>the categories are very important because they group in the same line all similar works</p>
